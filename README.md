# 📁 File Allocation Method Simulator

A web-based Operating System project that visually demonstrates three major file allocation techniques:

- Contiguous Allocation  
- Linked Allocation  
- Indexed Allocation  

This simulator bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical understanding by providing an interactive disk block visualization along with performance metrics.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

File allocation methods define how files are stored on secondary storage devices such as disks.  
Each allocation technique affects:

- Access Time  
- Disk Utilization  
- Fragmentation  

This project simulates and compares all three techniques in a dynamic and user-friendly web interface.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

To design and implement a web-based simulator that visually demonstrates Contiguous, Linked, and Indexed file allocation methods, along with performance metrics such as access time and disk utilization, in order to enhance practical understanding of Operating System concepts.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Allocation logic and dynamic visualization  

The entire system runs completely on the client side (no backend or database required).

## ⚙️ How the Simulator Works

1. User enters:
   - Disk Size  
   - File Size  
2. User selects the allocation method  
3. The simulator dynamically allocates disk blocks  
4. The system calculates:
   - Access Time  
   - Disk Utilization Percentage  
5. Results are displayed in a visual disk grid format

## 📊 Allocation Techniques Implemented

### 🔹 1. Contiguous Allocation
- Allocates consecutive disk blocks  
- Very fast access time  
- May cause external fragmentation  
- Difficult file expansion  

### 🔹 2. Linked Allocation
- Allocates non-consecutive blocks  
- Blocks are logically linked  
- Avoids external fragmentation  
- Higher access time due to traversal  

### 🔹 3. Indexed Allocation
- Uses an index block  
- Stores addresses of allocated blocks  
- Efficient random access  
- Requires extra index block
